title: About this blog
---

This is my third attempt at a blog. All preceding attempts failed very shortly after their inception, despite what in retrospect were much better conditions for blogging in general. Yet here I am again, repeating the same action and expecting a different result. Such foolishness demands an explanation.

Obviously, on one level I'm jumping on the text-web revival bandwagon most visible in all these new substack newsletters, but also in projects like [gemini](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/) and the [small web](https://ar.al/2020/08/07/what-is-the-small-web/). 

However, I'm not here to run a grift. My motivations are esoterically personal and straightforwardly political. This blog is an open notebook, a messy place for bricolage, in my attempts to work out a communist project fit for the 21st century.  

For those that care, it's also using the **XMin** Hugo theme [available on Github](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin) and hosted using [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
