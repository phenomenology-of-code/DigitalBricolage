This is my third attempt at a blog. All preceding attempts failed very shortly after their inception, despite what in retrospect were much better conditions for blogging in general. Yet here I am again, repeating the same action and expecting a different result. Such foolishness demands an explanation.

Obviously on one level I'm jumping on the same text-web revival bandwagon as all these new substack newsletter writers. However, I'm not here to run a grift. My motivations are esoterically personal and straightforwardly political. 

This blog is an open notebook, a messy place for bricolage, in my attempts to work out a communist project fit for the 21st century.
